# ChemHelp
This is a simple command line tool to perform common chemistry functions. It is meant to be used as supplementary tool, as it is not capable of tackling large, complex problems. It can perform the trivial calculations that are part of a problem and can be used to help check your work.

# Supported Operating Systems
Windows. That's it (sorry).

#Building
To build, simply download all the files, open up the project in Visual Studio, and build it. First you'll have to build the `core` project, *then* the `ChemHelp` project, otherwise you'll get an error that `core.lib` wasn't found.

# Installation
To install, simply place the `ChemHelp.exe` file from the build folders *and the `help-page.txt` file* (which can be downloaded from <a>http://tinyurl.com/chemhelp-help-page</a>) anywhere you want. Then add the location to your PATH variable (or install the executable in a location that's already part of your PATH variable). Then simply run `chemhelp ...` to use it.

<b>Important: if you don't download and copy `help-page.txt` to the same location as `ChemHelp.exe` then the command `chemhelp --help` will not work!</b>

# Uses
##Input format
Elements should be entered as written, e.g. Calcium is `Ca`, Iron is `Fe`, etc. *This program is indeed case sensitive!*
Compounds are entered as normal but subscripts should be entered as regular digits, e.g. `CO2`, `H2O`, etc.
Subgroups can be entered as well with the subgroup within parenthesis `(...)` and the subgroup count following the closing parenthesis, e.g. `Mg(NO3)2`.

<b>Note: currently charges of elements/compounds are not supported, do not try to include them!</b>
## Calculating molar masses
The program can be used to calculate the molar mass of an element, a list of elements, or a compound using the `-m` option. This can be done as such:

    > chemhelp -m Ca
    40.078 g/mol
    > chemhelp -m H2O
    18.015 g/mol
To get the molar masses of more than one element, simply group them together as if they were a compound and run the program in verbose mode with the `-v` flag:

    > chemhelp -mv HOCaPS
    
    =========================================
    |   elem|  count|  mol. mass|      total|
    =========================================
    |      H|      1|      1.008|      1.008|
    |      O|      1|     15.999|     15.999|
    |      S|      1|     32.065|     32.065|
    |     Ca|      1|     40.078|     40.078|
    |      P|      1|     30.974|     30.974|
    =========================================
    
    120.124 g/mol
Just ignore the total at the end.
##Performing stoichiometry
Simply use the `-s` option as such:

    > chemhelp -s [compound 1] [amount 1] [unit 1 (g|mol)] [compound 2] [unit 2 (g|mol)] [OPTIONAL: ratio (x:y)]
*Note that `unit 1` and `unit 2` need not be the same.* The `ratio` is optional and must be expressed as `x:y` where `x` and `y` are both integers. *Also, compounds 1 and 2 can both be elements if desired.*

Example:

    > chemhelp -s H2O 50 g H mol 1:2
    5.551 mol
##Balancing a reaction
To balance a reaction, simply use this format:

    > chemhelp -b [reactants (a+b+c...)]=[products (x+y+z...)]

<b>Important: if you wish to space the reactants/products like so: `C2H4 + O2 = CO2 + H2O`, they must be surrounded with quotes: `"C2H4 + O2 = CO2 + H2O"` or must not contain spaces: `C2H4+O2=CO2+H2O`</b>

Example:
    > chemhelp -b "C2H4 + O2 = CO2 + H2O"
    1, 3, 2, 2
The output is simply the coefficients listed in a row.

For the curious, you can also run it in verbose mode to see how the coefficients were solved for:

    Î» chemhelp -bv "C2H4 + O2 = CO2 + H2O"
    
    balancing equation: A[C2H4] + B[O2] -> C[CO2] + D[H2O]
    elements being examined: C H O
    num variables: 4
    num equations: 3
    
            A   B   C   D
       C[   2   0   1   0 ] <- starting equation
       H[   4   0   0   2 ]
       O[   0   2   2   1 ]
    
    equation 0: 2A = C
        A = 24  <- arbitrarily set
        C = 48  <- newly determined

    equation 1: 4A = 2D
        A = 24
        D = 48  <- newly determined

    equation 2: 2B = 2C + D
        C = 48
        D = 48
        B = 72  <- newly determined
    
    unsimplified coeffs: A = 24, B = 72, C = 48, D = 48
    divide all values by 24
    simplified coeffs: A = 1, B = 3, C = 2, D = 2
